# Zest'On

- From the 'Forkify' project of 'The Complete JS Course' of Jonas Schmedtmann, I created the 'Zest'On' app.                
- MVC model: HTML - CSS - JavaScript - Webpack (babel, html-webpack-plugin, axios, core-js...) - Food2Fork API                     
- Design adapted to my liking

### webpack --mode development
