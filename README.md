# Zest'On

- From the 'Forkify' project of 'The Complete JS Course' of Jonas Schmedtmann, I created the 'Zest'On' app.                
- MVC model: HTML - CSS - JavaScript - Webpack (babel, html-webpack-plugin, axios, core-js...) - Food2Fork API                     
- Design adapted to my liking

### Note:           
The free plan for the API key is limited to 50 requests per day.         
In case of extensive test/use of this app, and in order to avoid that you or the next person gets an error saying that *Something went wrong :(*
#### thanks in advance to register to Food2Fork https://www.food2fork.com/default/user/login?_next=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.food2fork.com%2F     
and get your own free API key :fire:
